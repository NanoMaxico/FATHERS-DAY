        HERE I WILL TELL MY MEMORIES!!!
    </h1>

    <h2>
        OH! TODAY IS FATHER'S DAY!!!(POPS DAY!)
        WELL I WON'T TYPE A LOT ELSE MY FINGERS WILL BREAK AND I CAN'T MAKE ANY OF THESE APP/WEB THING!
        SO MY DAD IS PRACTICALLY (I SAID PRACTICALLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OTHER WORD TO PUT THERE) 
        THE BEEEESSSSTTTTTTTT (THATS THE LONGEST "BEST" I WILL EVER TYPE) THOUGH HE COUDN'T SPEND THE 
        MOST OF THE TIME ME BECAUSE OF ME , BECAUSE I THINNK I JUST HAVE THE LONGEST SCREEN TIME ANY
        CHILD SHOULD BE HAVING (MY SUBCONSCIOUS MIND MOSTLY CONTROLS ME) BUT ALL THE FESTIVALS , THE HAPPY 
        MOMENTS , AND MANY MANY MANY (MANY HERE IS 3 TIMES FOR NO REASON) THE CUTE AN AMAZING HUGS WERE 
        SO WARM . HE BOUGHT ME EVERYTHING I WANTED AND I ALMOST BROKE EVERYTHING (LIKE I SAID...ITS NOT IN
        MY CONTROL) LIKE THE 9 TABS AND 5 LAPTOPS .(I DONT KNOW ABOUT MOBILE) THOUGH I DIDN'T STILL GET "MOST" 
        OF THE TIME WITH HIM BECAUSE OF HIM BEING "MOSTLY" AT HIS OFFICE AND I AM "MOSTLY" PLAYING AWAY IN
        TECH TIME STILL ALL MEMORIES ARE BETTER THAN THE BEST OF WHAT YOU CAN ASK FOR!!!
